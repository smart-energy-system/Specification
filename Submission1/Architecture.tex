The weather component is the component responsible for looking up weather data for registered supply and demand components.
The component reads registration data from the database and looks up weather data for each recorded entry.
The collected data is written back into the database in order to be usable for the rest of the system.

In order for the whole system to be reliable and responsive we devided the weather component from the rest of the system.
The weather component speaks only to the weather database where it get the locations for which it should collect weather data.
The collected data gets written into the database and stored.
Even in the case of a failure of the weather component the already collected data is still accessible and therefore the system can still access it, making the system independent of the weather component.
In the case of a new registration of a component during a weather component failure, the database may return default values for the new component in a way the running system is not being halted by missing data.
These measures should make the system reliable and and responsive in that context.
