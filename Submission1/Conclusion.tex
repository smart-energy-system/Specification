The power girds of the future will be different from the existing ones. More information will be used to make better decisions, more renewable energy sources will be integrated and more automation will happen. Also, microgrids will be a part of the energy concepts of the future. The simulation system presented in this report could help to gain a better understanding about different aspects of microgirds. The first section provided a motivation and introduction to microgirds. The next section contains basic information which are necessary to understand the problem, the functional requirements and an architecture description. The architecture is split in three layers. The webforntend, the logic layer which contains the simulation and the database layer. It also features a reliable approach to integrate an external weather component.\\

In the future more custom modules could be developed, to integrate different suppliers and consumers.
