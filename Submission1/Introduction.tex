\section{Introduction}

The traditional power grid is changing more and more over time.
Due to increasing sensititization for the use of renewable and reliable sources of energy instead of nuclear power sources, there is an increasing accomodation of renewable energy.
To fullfill our daily energy need only with such energy sources is quite difficult and needs lot of planning and simulation.
In this work we build a smart energy system to simulate a smart grid.

A smart grid is an energy efficient system with information and communication technology, automation and awareness of energy consumtion.
There are many different actors and technologies which are connected to each other and interoperate to optimate the grid.

A smart energy systems creates the bridge between a power grid and a resilient and reliable smart grid.
Users can simulate reliable energy sources, as well as different kinds of energy consumers, e.g. homes or offices.
Simulation of distributed energy sources and automation of processes build an energy management system.
Through this microgrids we can possibly rely completly on renewable energy sources in the future.
This can be checked with our smart energy system.
