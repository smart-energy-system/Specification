\subsection{User Stories}
\begin{enumerate}
\item As a user, I need to create a wind turbine in the simulation so that I can calculate the potential energy output.

\item As a user, I need to create a photovoltaic panel in the simulation so that I can calculate the potential energy output.

\item As a user, I need to create a battery in the simulation so that I can \textbf{visualize} the impact of the energy storage on the grid.

\item As a user, I need to create a home on the demand side in the simulation so that I can calculate the energy demand of the home.

\item As a user, I need to create a commercial building on the demand side in the simulation so that I can calculate the energy demand of the commercial building.

\item As a user, I need to  get continuously calculate dynamic prices per kWh form the simulation so that I can determine if I want to sell my produced energy or store it for later use or selling.


\item As a user, I need to use wetter data in the simulation so that the simulation gets more precise.

\item As a user, I need to be able to use already saved wetter data in the simulation so that the dependency on the availability of the wetter service is reduced.

\item As a user, I need to use the simulation to generate a forecast for energy generation and demand so that I can make informed decisions.

\item As a user, I want to add customizable suppler modules to the simulation so that ...

\item As a user, I want to add customizable consumer modules to the simulation so that ...

\item As a user, I need to run the simulation in an island mode which does not contain a connection to the main power grid so that I'm independent of the main power grid and its failures.

\item As a user, I need to get a visual notification if the supply is smaller than the demand so that I know that I have to add more energy supplier.

\item As a user, I need that the battery is used if the supply is smaller than the demand and it has enough charge so that ...

\item As a user, I need that the battery is recharged if the demand is greater than the supply so that ...

\item As a user, I need that the battery is recharged if the demand is greater than the supply so that ...

\item As a user, I need that the main power is used to manage peak demands if the microgrid has a connection to the main power so that ...

\item As a user, I need that the demand side simulation features standard loads like lighting so that...

\item As a user, I need that the demand side consumers feature different load scenarios like home users and commercial users (constant load, occasionally peak loads) so that ...

\item As a user, I need to use the system with my webbrowser so that I can use different platforms to view it.

\item As a user, I need to visualize different metrics so that ...

\item As a user, I need to view the current electric demand of the grid so that...

\item As a user, I need to view the electric consumption of the grid so that...

\item As a user, I want to adjust the demand by postponing the use of devices during peak hours so that...

\item As a user, I need that the simulation adapts the demand based the price per kWh so that...
