\begin{enumerate}
\item As a user, I need to create one or more wind turbines in the simulation so that I can calculate the potential energy output.

\item As a user, I need to create one or more photovoltaic panels in the simulation so that I can calculate the potential energy output.

\item As a user, I need to create one or more batteries in the simulation so to save unused energy of in my simulation.

\item As a user, I need to get the charge state of my batteries to know the impact of the energy storage on the grid.

\item As a user, I need to create one or more homes on the demand side in the simulation so that I can simulate some energy consumer.

\item As a user, I need to create one or more commercial buildings on the demand side in the simulation so to simulate some high energy consumer.

\item As a user, I need to get dynamic energy prices calculated from the simulation to determine if I want to sell my produced energy or store it for later use.

\item As a user, I need to use weather data in the simulation to simulate the smart energy system more precise and realistic.

\item As a user, I need to use already saved wetter data in the simulation to not be dependent on the availability of the weather service.

\item As a user, I need to generate a forecast for energy generation and demand using the simulation in order to make informed decisions.

\item As a developer, I want to add more supplier modules than wind tubines and photovoltaic pannels to the simulation to improve the smart energy system in the future with further technology. 

\item As a developer, I want to add more consumer modules to the simulation to be able to add more consumer than homes and commercial buildings. 

\item As a user, I want to be able to create a smart energy system which is independent to an power grid to simulate a reliable smart grid.

\item As a user, I want to get a visual notification if the supply of energy is smaller than the demand of energy to know when more energy supplier are needed.

\item As a demand module, I need to get energy from the (charged) batteries if the provided supply to small for my demand so that I still have enough money.
