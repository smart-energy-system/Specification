For our smart energy system we need a weather service which can provide all needed data on a hourly basis.
There is one weather service which fullfills our needs more than appropriate.
The weather service \url{weatherbit.io} has different kinds of endpoints on its API.
In our case we use two of them, the current weather data API and the 48 hours weather forecast API.

Before we take a look at the endpoints provided to the user and their responses, we want to present the data collectable on weatherbit.io.
