To implement the constraints we use the library choco solver\footnote{\url{http://www.choco-solver.org/}}. This library helps us to solve the optimization problem for integer variables. As a consequence of this only integer variables are possible and double variables have to be rounded. As described above we would like to use Watts as the unit of measurements for our variables. But this would result in large numbers and a huge rage for the variables. To circumvent this we convert everything to kW. This helps to reduce the rage for each variable and therefore speeds up the solving process. The bounds for the variables are configurable by the user but should remain as low as the specific problem allows. Otherwise, the calculation time and the RAM requirements are pretty high. To make the calculation of an optimal solution feasible it was necessary to limit the number of consumers to two. This could be one household and one office. Furthermore, only one battery and one supplier is supported. A workaround to this limitations is to combine the loads of different consumers and the combine the supply of different suppliers. For the suppliers there is no difference in the computation of all of them get combined before the optimization.
